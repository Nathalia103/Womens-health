      <h2>Pregnancy Trimesters</h2>
      <p><strong>First Trimester (Weeks 1–12):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What’s Happening:</strong> Your baby is developing rapidly, and your body starts producing hormones that can cause fatigue, nausea, and mood swings.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Morning sickness, fatigue, breast tenderness.</li>
        <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Start prenatal vitamins (folic acid), avoid alcohol, and schedule your first prenatal appointment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Second Trimester (Weeks 13–26):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What’s Happening:</strong> Your baby is growing and developing its organs. It’s often called the "honeymoon phase" as many women feel better.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Decreased morning sickness, increased energy, visible baby bump.</li>
        <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Get an ultrasound to check your baby’s growth and gender (if you want to know!), continue prenatal care, and start considering your birth plan.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Third Trimester (Weeks 27–40):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What’s Happening:</strong> Your baby is growing rapidly, and you might feel uncomfortable with all the extra weight. Your body starts preparing for labor.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Backaches, swollen feet, frequent urination, difficulty sleeping.</li>
        <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Attend birthing classes, pack your hospital bag, finalize your birth plan, and stay in touch with your doctor about any concerns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Know Before Giving Birth</h2>
      <p>Giving birth is a life-changing experience, and it’s important to be as prepared as possible. Here’s a checklist:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Know Your Birth Plan:</strong> A birth plan outlines your preferences for labor, delivery, and aftercare. This can include pain management options, who you want with you in the room, and your preferences for the baby’s first moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Pain Relief Options:</strong> Natural methods like breathing techniques or water therapy, or medical options like epidurals and morphine. Discuss them with your doctor beforehand.</li>
        <li><strong>Packing Your Hospital Bag:</strong> Essentials include comfy clothes, toiletries, snacks, phone charger, and your baby's essentials (clothes, swaddle blankets, diapers).</li>
        <li><strong>Signs of Labor:</strong> Contractions, water breaking, or lower back pain are common signs that labor is approaching. Be prepared to head to the hospital when they start.</li>
      </ul>
